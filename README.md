# Anxiety Level Classification Using LVQ and Wearable Data

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to classify anxiety levels using the Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) algorithm based on physiological data from wearable devices. The model is designed to categorize stress into three classes: **Low**, **Normal**, and **High**, with a maximum accuracy of **95.26%**.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

Mental health has become a global concern in recent years. Physiological data from wearable devices like smartwatches and fitness trackers offers great potential in supporting real-time monitoring and early detection of stress and anxiety. This project utilizes LVQ (Learning Vector Quantization), a prototype-based supervised learning algorithm, to classify anxiety levels based on body humidity, temperature, and step count.
